# GI: Git Ignore
### Generates a .gitignore file base on many different languages

## Installation
> Include the gi file on your path

## Usage
```sh
gi [language]
```
> Their are multiple languages available.  All the contents of the generated `.gitignore` files are from [gitignore.io](http://gitignore.io).  To add more than one template just run `gi` again with the next template, and you will be prompted to either replace, append, or cancel.
